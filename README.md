# What is a Repository?
_A repository is a place where you can essentially upload and store your files, codes, and more! Through a repository, you can easily find all the data you've uploaded pertaining to something, making it an organized way to keep track of everything you do! Subsequently, others can also view and access the stored work, when given the permissions, making it accessible to team members when working on a project together!_
