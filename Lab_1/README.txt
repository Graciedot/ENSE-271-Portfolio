When I was developing my story mapping, one of the very first things I did was think about the way other applications function. I tried to imagine myself in someone else's shoes who would need the app, and from there, began jotting down ideas for potential functions 
of the grocery app. Because I was focused on mainly the user, I tried to zero in on details that would make the user experience as convenient as possible. This meant that using familiar app functions, like login information and payment interfaces, were impartive to
achieve this 'familiarity' I was aiming for. Most importantly, though, I had to pretend as though I was the person the app was being built for. I ended up creating stories for each party involved within the story mapping process. There is countless amount of reasons
why a person may choose to utilize a particular app; but they all ultimately come down to one sole reason -- at least in the case of this app -- which is to purchase groceries. Subsequently, the other two parties also have their own goals they need to acheive through
the app; sell the groceries (administrative) and deliver the groceries (delivery/employed party). With these three pretend personas, I began using my own experience with apps and the real world to try and come up with something I could see myself, along with others,
using in order to purchase groceries online - of course, it will pertain to my bias due to the fact that there is no real customer with certain requests.
.
Throughout the entirety of the story mapping, I ended up having to make several decisions. One of the decisions that I made, which I struggled a lot trying to decide whether or not I should, was simplifying the map. Originally, the map I had made was COVERED in notes.
All of these notes, I had deemd important to the map -- but realized that I was literally filling my entire map with every single idea I had. A lot of them were also incredibly specific, with little to no room for alternatives and changes. I ended up needing to take
a step back and re-evaluate the notes that I was putting down. In doing so, I ended up wiping out quite a few of them because most were unnecessary, especially in the stages I had placed them in. This made my work look a lot neater, and also made it a lot easier
to make sense of.
Another decision I made pertains specifically to the grocery stores itself. When I first envisioned the app, I originally imagined it as though it was one single grocery store connected to the app, as though the grocery store was literally DEDICATED to the app
itself. Sitting with that idea, I realized that the logistics itself would involve much more than just the app, but also the fact that, if this were real, the app would suffer financially due to being restricted to just ONE grocery store. Because of this, I
ended up quickly vetoeing that idea, instead deciding to make the app as though it would be partnered with several different grocery stores. This would, obviously, lead to income coming in from various different directions rather than just one sole source.
Something else I decided to go with is using particular logins for the three parties involved in the Epics; the administrator; the delivery employee; and the shopper. It made sense, in my mind, that each person would have their own form of login. The shopper,
of course, would have the simplest form of signing in as they are the customer. They should, arguably, have the easiest way to enter the app. However, the admin and employees are roles that require responsibility in relation to both the store and the app.
This means that, unlike the customer, they need to have certain credentials and login procedures in order to create a more difficult, but secure, access to admin and employee sections of the app. The idea is that it makes it hard for regular people to access
sections of the app that aren't meant for them. Admin and Employees are meant to enter into the app with specific codes unique to themselves which grants them access to their respective places within the app. I also made it so Employees need their credentials
verified, meaning not just anyone can be responsible for the handling of someone else's groceries. Both Admin and Employees will also receive two-factor authentication before regular shoppers. All of this was for the purpose of enforcing security measures.
.
I ended up trying a lot of different functions overall, but one specific function I chose was to assign personas to the Epic cards. Originally, I had not intention of doing so, but as I was working through my first rendition of story mapping (that involved WAY
too many cards), I began to lose sight of what exactly I was making cards for. Because of this, I found that visually adding a persona reminded me of what goals I was striving to achieve with all the other cards. It gave the goals a 'person' I could visually
attach a narrative to.
I also ended up changing the colours of the cards. This helped separate each section more clearly in comparison to all of the release cards being white. It allowed my brain to quickly process, at a glance, where each card sat. It also directed attention to 
cards that had extra information; the three cards that had things written in their details, etc. The difference in colour made it significantly easier to point these cards out so I wouldn't have to sift through all of them until I find the right ones.
